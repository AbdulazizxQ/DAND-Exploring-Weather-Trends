# DAND-Exploring-Weather-Trends
#Exploring weather trends is a Udacity project that is required to finish the nanodegree. It was about exploring a data set which had weather temperatures for differant cities. The main idea was to compare the local average temps (for me it was Mecca) with the global average temps and seeing the trends over the years.
